## Project Overview

In our third year at university, we embarked on an academic project, carefully chosen from a myriad of options available to us. Our project was a multifaceted endeavor, integrating both developmental and research-oriented components.

The developmental phase encompassed the creation of a backend API and a Chrome extension, with my primary involvement focusing on these aspects. Conversely, the heart of the project revolved around extensive research and the subsequent development of a model.

The collaborative effort was led by the following team members:
  - Oumayma Rhab
  - Oussema Jaouadi
  - Taha Mediouni

For a comprehensive understanding of our project, please refer to the detailed report uploaded [here](./PPP_Report.pdf). It's important to note that a significant portion of the model code, API code, and extension code was unfortunately lost, and the remaining artifact is the project report.
